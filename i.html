  <h1>A Header</h1>
  <div>
  <p>These pages are intended to be explored in the developer console of your browser.</p><br>
  <p>A paragraph of text. Whatever <i>line</i> wrapping that is present in the file or lots of extra spaces in the file are generally ignored and the text is re-wrapped based on the width of browser.</p><br>
  <p>You can add a style like <strong>bold</strong> to some text by enclosing it in the <em>appropriate</em> tag.</p>
  <p>You can even <span>put</span> some text so that it is a <a href="https://www.wa4e.com/code/html/lists.htm">link to another page.</a></p>
</div>
  <pre>
    If you                use the pre tag
       The browser respects spaces
    and 
    line 
    ends 
              and shows the text in a 
              monospace font.
